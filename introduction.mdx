## Quick Example

Send an email and receive webhooks for replies:

```javascript
import { Inbound } from 'inboundemail'

const inbound = new Inbound(process.env.INBOUND_API_KEY)

// Send an email
const email = await inbound.emails.send({
  from: 'Inbound User <hello@yourdomain.com>',
  to: 'user@example.com',
  subject: 'Welcome!',
  html: '<p>Thanks for signing up!</p>',
  tags: [{ name: 'campaign', value: 'welcome' }]
})

console.log(`Email sent: ${email.id}`)
```

Receive and process incoming emails:

```javascript
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import { Inbound, isInboundWebhookPayload } from 'inboundemail'

const inbound = new Inbound(process.env.INBOUND_API_KEY)

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const payload = await request.json()
  
  if (!isInboundWebhookPayload(payload)) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Invalid webhook' }, { status: 400 })
  }
  
  const { email } = payload
  console.log(`📧 Received: ${email.subject} from ${email.from?.addresses?.[0]?.address}`)
  
  // Auto-reply to support emails
  if (email.subject?.toLowerCase().includes('support')) {
    await inbound.reply(email, {
      from: 'support@yourdomain.com',
      text: 'Thanks for contacting support! We\'ll get back to you within 24 hours.'
    })
  }
  
  return NextResponse.json({ success: true })
}
```
