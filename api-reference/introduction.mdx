## Welcome to Inbound API

Inbound provides a REST API for managing email infrastructure programmatically. Send and receive emails, manage domains, configure email addresses, and trigger webhooks with a simple, modern API.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://inbound.new/api/e2/
```

## REST API Principles

The Inbound API follows REST conventions:

- **Resource-oriented URLs**: Each endpoint represents a specific resource (domains, emails, email-addresses, endpoints)
- **HTTP methods**: Standard methods indicate the action:
  - `GET` - Retrieve resources
  - `POST` - Create new resources
  - `PATCH` - Update existing resources
  - `DELETE` - Remove resources
- **JSON everywhere**: All requests and responses use JSON format
- **Standard HTTP status codes**: Success and error responses use conventional HTTP codes

## Request Format

All requests must include:

```http
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

Request body example:

```json
{
  "domain": "yourdomain.com"
}
```

## Response Format

All responses are returned in JSON format with appropriate HTTP status codes.

### Success Response (200/201)

```json
{
  "id": "dom_abc123",
  "domain": "yourdomain.com",
  "status": "pending",
  "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### List Response with Pagination

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "dom_abc123",
      "domain": "yourdomain.com"
    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "limit": 50,
    "offset": 0,
    "total": 150,
    "hasMore": true
  }
}
```

### Error Response (4xx/5xx)

```json
{
  "error": "Domain is required",
  "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR"
}
```

## API Versioning

The current API version is **E2** (version 2). The version is included in the URL path:

```
https://inbound.new/api/e2/domains
```

When breaking changes are introduced, a new version will be released. The previous version will continue to be supported for a deprecation period.

## API Structure

The E2 API is organized into logical resource groups:

### Core Resources

- **`/domains`** - Manage email domains and DNS verification
- **`/email-addresses`** - Create and configure email addresses
- **`/emails`** - Send, receive, and manage emails
- **`/endpoints`** - Configure webhooks and forwarding rules

### Additional Resources

- **`/guard`** - Spam filtering and security rules
- **`/mail/threads`** - Email thread/conversation management
- **`/attachments`** - Access email attachments

## Getting Started

1. **Get your API key** from the [Inbound dashboard](https://inbound.new)
2. **Add a domain** to verify ownership
3. **Create an email address** with a webhook endpoint
4. **Start receiving emails** at your webhook URL

## SDKs

Official SDK for Node.js/TypeScript:

```bash
npm install inboundemail
```

```typescript
import { Inbound } from 'inboundemail'

const inbound = new Inbound(process.env.INBOUND_API_KEY)

const domain = await inbound.domains.create({
  domain: 'yourdomain.com'
})
```

## Rate Limits

All API endpoints are rate limited to ensure fair usage. See [Rate Limits](/api-reference/rate-limits) for details.
