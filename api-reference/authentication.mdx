---

## Overview

The Inbound API uses **Bearer token authentication** with API keys. All API requests must include a valid API key in the `Authorization` header.

## API Key Management

### Getting Your API Key

1. Log in to your [Inbound dashboard](https://inbound.new)
2. Navigate to Settings > API Keys
3. Generate a new API key
4. Store it securely - it won't be shown again

### API Key Format

API keys are prefixed for identification:

```
inbnd_sk_abc123def456ghi789jkl...
```

## Authentication Methods

The API supports two authentication methods:

### 1. API Key (Recommended)

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header with the `Bearer` scheme:

```http
GET /api/e2/domains HTTP/1.1
Host: inbound.new
Authorization: Bearer inbnd_sk_abc123def456ghi789jkl
Content-Type: application/json
```

### 2. Session Cookie

When making requests from the browser dashboard, session-based authentication is used automatically. This is not recommended for API integrations.

## Making Authenticated Requests

### Using cURL

```bash
curl https://inbound.new/api/e2/domains \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Using JavaScript/TypeScript

```typescript
const response = await fetch('https://inbound.new/api/e2/domains', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.INBOUND_API_KEY}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
})

const data = await response.json()
```

### Using the SDK

```typescript
import { Inbound } from 'inboundemail'

const inbound = new Inbound(process.env.INBOUND_API_KEY)

// Authentication is handled automatically
const domains = await inbound.domains.list()
```

## Authentication Errors

### 401 Unauthorized

Returned when authentication is missing or invalid.

**Missing Authorization Header:**

```json
{
  "error": "Unauthorized",
  "message": "Authentication required. Provide a valid session cookie or Bearer token.",
  "statusCode": 401
}
```

**Response Headers:**

```http
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="API", charset="UTF-8"
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
```

**Invalid API Key:**

```json
{
  "error": "Unauthorized",
  "message": "Authentication required. Provide a valid session cookie or Bearer token.",
  "statusCode": 401
}
```

### 503 Service Unavailable

Returned when the rate limiting service is temporarily unavailable:

```json
{
  "error": "Service Unavailable",
  "message": "Rate limiting service is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later.",
  "statusCode": 503
}
```

**Response Headers:**

```http
HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable
Retry-After: 60
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
```

## Security Best Practices

<Warning>
  **Never expose your API keys** in client-side code, public repositories, or logs.
</Warning>

### Store Keys Securely

- Use environment variables for API keys
- Never commit keys to version control
- Rotate keys periodically
- Use separate keys for different environments

### Environment Variables

```bash
# .env (never commit this file)
INBOUND_API_KEY=inbnd_sk_abc123def456ghi789jkl
```

```typescript
// Use in your application
const apiKey = process.env.INBOUND_API_KEY

if (!apiKey) {
  throw new Error('INBOUND_API_KEY is not configured')
}
```

### Key Rotation

1. Generate a new API key in the dashboard
2. Update your application with the new key
3. Test that everything works
4. Delete the old API key

### Limiting Key Access

- Create separate API keys for different applications or environments
- Use different keys for development, staging, and production
- Delete unused keys immediately

## Authentication Flow

When you make an authenticated request:

1. **API receives request** with `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
2. **Token validation** - checks if API key is valid and active
3. **User identification** - retrieves `userId` associated with the key
4. **Rate limit check** - verifies user hasn't exceeded limits
5. **Request processed** - if all checks pass

## Testing Authentication

Test your API key with a simple request:

```bash
curl https://inbound.new/api/e2/domains \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

Successful response:

```json
{
  "data": [],
  "pagination": {
    "limit": 50,
    "offset": 0,
    "total": 0,
    "hasMore": false
  }
}
```

## Multi-tenant Isolation

All API requests are automatically scoped to your user account. You can only access resources that belong to your account.

```typescript
// All queries are automatically scoped by userId
const domains = await db
  .select()
  .from(emailDomains)
  .where(eq(emailDomains.userId, userId)) // Automatic isolation
```

This ensures complete data isolation between accounts.
