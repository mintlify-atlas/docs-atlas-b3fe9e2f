The Inbound MCP (Model Context Protocol) server allows AI assistants to interact with your Inbound account to manage domains, endpoints, and emails.

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI assistants to securely connect to external data sources and tools. With Inbound's MCP server, your AI assistant can:

- List and manage your email domains
- Create and configure webhook endpoints
- Send, receive, and search emails
- View email threads and conversations
- Access full email content including attachments

## Quick Start

The fastest way to get started is using Inbound's hosted MCP server at `mcp.inbound.new/mcp`.

### Cursor

Add to your Cursor MCP config (`.cursor/mcp.json` in your project or global config):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "inbound": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.inbound.new/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "x-inbound-api-key": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### OpenCode

Add to your `opencode.json` config:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "inbound": {
      "type": "remote",
      "url": "https://mcp.inbound.new/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "x-inbound-api-key": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "inbound": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@inbound/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "INBOUND_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<Note>
Claude Desktop uses STDIO transport and runs the MCP server locally via npx.
</Note>

## Authentication

The MCP server authenticates using your Inbound API key. Get your API key from the [dashboard](https://inbound.new/settings).

### Domain Restriction (Optional)

To restrict all operations to a single domain (and its subdomains), add the `x-inbound-domain` header:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "inbound": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.inbound.new/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "x-inbound-api-key": "your-api-key",
        "x-inbound-domain": "example.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This will filter results to show only `example.com` and subdomains like `mail.example.com`, `support.example.com`, etc.

## Available Tools

### Domains

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `list_domains` | List all domains in your account (respects domain restriction) |

### Endpoints

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `list_endpoints` | List webhook and email forwarding endpoints |
| `create_endpoint` | Create a webhook, email forward, or email group endpoint |

### Emails

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `list_emails` | List sent, received, and scheduled emails with filtering |
| `get_email` | Get detailed information about a specific email including full content |
| `send_email` | Send or schedule an email |

### Threads

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `list_threads` | List email conversations with previews |
| `get_thread` | Get all messages in a thread |

## Example Use Cases

### Email Management

Once configured, you can ask your AI assistant to:

- "List all my domains"
- "Show me the last 10 received emails"
- "Send an email to support@example.com with subject 'Hello'"
- "Get the full content of email ID abc123"
- "Show me the conversation thread with john@example.com"

### AI Agent Integration

Perfect for building AI agents that need email capabilities:

```typescript
// Your AI agent can now:
// 1. Monitor incoming emails via list_emails
// 2. Parse and understand email content with get_email
// 3. Draft responses using LLM
// 4. Send emails via send_email
// 5. Track conversations with list_threads and get_thread
```

## Available Prompts

The MCP server includes a `getting-started` prompt that teaches the AI assistant how to use Inbound effectively. Most AI assistants will automatically discover and use this prompt.

## Self-Hosting

You can also run the MCP server locally:

### Installation

```bash
npm install @inbound/mcp
# or
pnpm add @inbound/mcp
# or
bun add @inbound/mcp
```

### Running

```bash
# HTTP server (for Cursor, OpenCode, etc.)
INBOUND_API_KEY=your-api-key npx @inbound/mcp start:http

# STDIO server (for Claude Desktop)
npx @inbound/mcp
```

The HTTP server runs on port 3002 by default. Configure your client to use `http://localhost:3002/mcp`.

## Security Best Practices

<Warning>
Never commit your API key to version control. Use environment variables or a secrets manager.
</Warning>

**Best practices:**

- Use environment variables for API keys: `"x-inbound-api-key": "$INBOUND_API_KEY"`
- Restrict operations to specific domains using `x-inbound-domain`
- Regularly rotate your API keys
- Use separate API keys for different environments (dev, staging, production)
- Monitor API usage in your Inbound dashboard

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Tools not appearing">
    Make sure your API key is valid and has the necessary permissions. Check the MCP server logs for authentication errors.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Domain filtering not working">
    Ensure the `x-inbound-domain` header value matches exactly with your domain name in Inbound (case-sensitive).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Connection refused">
    If self-hosting, verify the server is running and the port is accessible. For the hosted version, check your network connectivity.

  <Accordion title="Rate limits reached">
    The MCP server respects your account's rate limits. Check your plan limits in the dashboard or upgrade for higher limits.

## Configuration in stainless.yml

The MCP server is automatically generated from our OpenAPI spec using Stainless. Configuration:

```yaml
targets:
  typescript:
    options:
      mcp_server:
        package_name: inbound-docs-mcp
        enable_all_resources: true
        host:
          stainless: true
```

This ensures the MCP server has access to all API resources and is automatically deployed to the hosted endpoint.
